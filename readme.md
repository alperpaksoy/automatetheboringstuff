These files are Python projects so far completed by me towards the practice projects assigned on a chapter basis in the excellent book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart. Pls feel free to copy and compare them with your own solutions.  

If you need the public in-course material or the programs or the files used in the book, visit the [website](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) associated with the book which is available there under a Creative Commons [license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/legalcode). I also strongly recommend his course in Udemy under the same title.

I have re-run all the programs before copying them to this repository to make sure they are working properly to a large extent. However, they are developed in Python 3 running on mac OS. You may have to tweak some of them a bit if you download and try to run them, especially on a non-mac OS computer.
