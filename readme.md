These files are Python projects completed by Alper Paksoy towards the practice projects 
assigned by chapter  in the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" book by Al Sweigart.

If you need the public in-course material or the programs or the files used in the book,

Pls note that programs here are developed on Python 3 running on top of Darwin (mac OS).
You may have to tweak them before running successfully especially if you download and
try to run them on a non-Darwin computer.
