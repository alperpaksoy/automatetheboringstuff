These files are Python projects completed by me towards the practice projects assigned on a chapter basis in the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart.

I have re-run all the programs before copying them to this repository to make sure they are working properly to a large extent. However, they are developed on Python 3 running on Darwin (mac OS). You may have to tweak some of them a bit if you download and try to run them, especially on a non-Darwin computer.
