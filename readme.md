These files are Python projects completed by Alper Paksoy towards the practice projects 
assigned by chapter  in the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" book by Al Sweigart.

If you need the public in-course material or the programs or the files used in the book,

I have re-run all the programs stored here to make sure that they are working properly 
to a large extent. However, they are developed on Python 3 running on top of Darwin 
(mac OS). You may have to tweak some of them a bit if you download and try to run them 
on especially a non-Darwin computer.
