These files are Python projects completed by Alper Paksoy towards the practice projects 
assigned by chapter  in the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" book by Al Sweigart.

I have re-run all the programs before transferring them to this repository to make 
sure they are working properly to a large extent. However, they are developed on 
Python 3 running on Darwin (mac OS). You may have to tweak some of them a bit if you 
download and try to run them, especially on a non-Darwin computer.
